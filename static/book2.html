                <h1>How to write a book</h1>

                

                <blockquote>
  <p>“I hate writing; I love having written.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>taking the approach “better late than half-assed” to the extreme. that might be bad advice, because
in general, finishing something in a sensible timeframe is more important than getting it perfect!
nevertheless I think O’Reilly ended up being okay with the fact that I missed my manuscript
submission deadline by <em>n</em> years.</p>

<p>my original proposal and ToC. ended up being quite different from nathan marz’ book</p>

<p>Curiosity.

<p>Will you write another book?</p>

<p>By contrast, if you write a book with a publisher like O’Reilly, you can focus mostly on just
writing the book. I don’t need to negotiate distribution deals, handle refund requests, or set up
stalls at conferences – they do all of that.  Not to mention all the editing, reviewing, and design
effort that goes into a book. Of course the publisher take a cut, but I think it’s a fair deal,
since they really do a lot of work.</p>

<p>traditional publisher versus self-publishing. You probably sell fewer copies when self-publishing,
but you get to keep a higher percentage. The question is, which of the two effects is the dominant
one? Hard to say in general.</p>

<p>Even if the self-publishing service gives you an ISBN, that doesn’t mean anyone will be able to
order a copy of the book through a local retailer.</p>

<p>Branding, worldwide distribution (people in many countries can buy from a local retailer rather than
having to get the book shipped from the US, incurring shipping costs, waiting time, and potentially
import duty). Not having to deal with fulfilment is great (shipping posters was a lot of hassle).
Sponsorship deals. A bit of marketing, e.g. having a stall at some conferences, although I like to
think that my own marketing (through conference talks, blog posts, and social media) was a greater
contribution to the book’s success.</p>

<p>First editor was helpful. Copyeditor was good. Indexer not so much. (Did you check out the index?
I put a lot of effort into it!)</p>

<p>Criteria for publisher: drm-free, not too expensive, royalty terms, print production quality, reputation</p>

<p>I don’t trust DRM to be long-lasting. A print copy or a non-DRM PDF will most likely still “work” in
50 years. But I don’t trust that a DRM system will still be working in 5 years time, let alone 50.</p>

<p>O’Reilly animals</p>

<p>One thing that I have found challenging: often you can make a simple statement that is 95% true, but
which comes with some exceptions, and which is not quite correct for the remaining 5%. To what
extent should we chase after those edge cases? On the one hand, we don’t want to say something that
is untrue, so we should acknowledge the exceptions when they exist. On the other hand, if every
single statement you make is peppered with caveats, and the caveats come with sub-caveats to address
the exceptions within the exceptions, then your writing gets very verbose and clumsy, and it will
not be helpful to the readers who just wanted to get the high-level overview and who don’t care
about the obscure edge cases. A middle ground is to weaken statements through handwaving, using
phrases such as “broadly speaking”, “generally”, “as a rule of thumb”, etc., but this risks making
the text vague and unspecific. I don’t have a good solution to this conundrum, but I believe it’s
important to make a conscious trade-off in this regard.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’re considering writing a book, I would suggest starting by writing extended blog posts, and
seeing what kind of response you get from readers. That was how I got into writing: I had ideas that
I wanted to articulate, so I wrote them up on http://martin.kleppmann.com/ and they turned out to be
popular. As the blog posts kept getting longer (some over 4,000 words), I realised that “this is
hardly a blog post, it’s more like half a chapter from a book”, and so I started mapping out what
such a book would look like. Given the popularity of my blog posts, it was fairly easy to get
publishers interested.</p>

<p>I would say that if you want to write a book, the primary reason should be the learning experience
that the writing process will provide for yourself: when you finish writing, you will understand the
topic very well yourself, because you’ve had to explain it to readers in great detail. Prestige or
financial reward should be secondary, because they are not guaranteed. Writing a book is a big time
commitment (I probably spent about 2.5 years of full-time equivalent work on my book, spread out
over 4 years), and it could well be that you can do other things in that time (e.g. working on an
important project in industry) that would be more rewarding, more prestigious, and more impactful.</p>

<p>Hope that perspective is somewhat useful.</p>

<p>Advice on writing (from an email to Mitch Seymour <a href="mailto:mitchseymour@gmail.com">mitchseymour@gmail.com</a>):</p>

<p>What worked for me was this: I tried to be very conscious of: 1. which concepts the reader has
already seen and which they haven’t (in order to ensure a logical progression of ideas); and 2.
which things I myself understand and which I don’t.</p>

<p>While writing I found myself often wanting to write some vague statement in order to paper over the
fact that I actually didn’t fully understand something (e.g. the reason why something is done one
way rather than another). Once I confronted my own lack of understanding, I then forced myself to
research the topic to the point that I could honestly say to myself that I got it. That done, I was
able to replace the vague statement with a precise one (a correct, but hopefully still simple
statement). Then I was happy.</p>

<p>The research was sometimes reading blog posts/papers/documentation, sometimes asking people,
sometimes trying out stuff for myself. For some topics I was surprised about the total lack of
decent write-ups on the topic. So this sometimes took a fair amount of time.</p>

<p>At times of doubt, I told myself: if it’s taking me a long time to figure out the answer to some
question, then it would take a reader just as long to do the same. Thus, if I can find the answer
and explain it concisely, I will have saved the reader a lot of time. If there was only one reader,
this would be a zero-sum game. But hopefully there will be many readers, and so the effort that
I put in will be magnified many times over. Thus, if I can put in time in order to save readers
time, I should do it.</p>

<p>I guess the short answer is just “spend a lot of time on it to make it good”! I probably spent about
2.5 years full-time equivalent writing my book (spread over the course of about 4 years). But
I think the effort has paid off.</p>
