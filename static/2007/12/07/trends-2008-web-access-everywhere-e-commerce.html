                <h1>Trends 2008: Web access everywhere; e-commerce</h1>

                
                <p style="font-size: 80%">Published by Martin Kleppmann on 07 Dec 2007.</p>
                

                <p>The mobile web is talked about a lot by people who have a vested interest in the mobile web becoming
popular. The frequently-cited arguments in favour of web usage on mobile phones sound pretty
convincing until you realise that most of those people talking so passionately about it have
invested in the mobile web, and therefore may be stating their wishful thinking rather than an
observed reality. (I am, unfortunately, no exception, being a
<a href="http://www.eptcomputing.com/">mobile web developer</a> myself.)</p>

<p>Mobile internet use has been hyped a
lot – WAP has been around since the late nineties, and many people originally speculated on it
being a huge success. Well, it never was in most parts of the world. It’s quite understandable that
observers are now rather more cautious when it is announced that the mobile web is finally here, and
that it is about to engulf the mainstream consumer.</p>

<p>In such an environment it is refreshing to hear
the opinion of a neutral organisation who simply observes what is going on in the minds of consumers
worldwide.
<a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/">Trendwatching.com</a> produces well researched monthly briefings on the
latest consumer trends worldwide. I have been following them for a while, wondering when the time
would come that they would announce the mobile web as a major consumer trend. And now, in December
2007, the time has arrived. They announce in their predictions for
<a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/briefing/">8 important consumer trends in 2008</a>
(<a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/pdf/2007_12_8trends2008.pdf">PDF</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Five years ago, we introduced ONLINE OXYGEN as the engine behind all this excitement: control-craving consumers
needing online access as much as they need oxygen. […] If there’s one device that’s going to
introduce another few hundred million people to the online world, it’s the phone. And yes,
initiatives like Google’s Android and ‘their bidding on the 700MHz band’ and WiMax and so on are
definitely going to speed things up. […] don’t count on consumers’ insatiable demand to be
online 24/7 to remain unmet forever.”</p>

  <p>– Trendwatching.com,
<a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/pdf/2007_12_8trends2008.pdf">“Online Oxygen”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although still a bit cautious in their wording, and emphasising that it won’t happen overnight, the
trendwatchers have confirmed that the mobile web is not just a bubble. The signs are set for
internet access anywhere, at any time, on almost any device, and it’s looking as though we won’t be
able to imagine a world without it in a reasonably small number of years’ time.</p>

<p>But what is all
that online access to be used for? E-commerce and social networking, say the trendwatchers. Social
networking is a bit difficult to grasp, I think; it’s another one of those areas with a lot of hype
and not necessarily much substance. E-commerce is a very important reality though, as
<a href="http://www.computing.co.uk/computing/news/2205120/online-sales-rise-130bn">yesterday’s article from Computing points
out</a> (UK online sales
have risen by 29% since last year, reaching £130bn). And Trendwatching.com are convinced that this
trend is going to
continue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes, the Next Big Thing can be right under your nose. Consider the
online riches to be reaped in 2008 from… ecommerce! Sure, it’s been around for years and years,
but prepare for a forceful ‘sequel’. After all, never before have so many consumers been willing to
overcome security threats, still shockingly bad (or boring) design, and delivery screwups. In other
words, 2008 could be a goldmine for smart e-tailers, who, if they get their act together, could make
billions and billions of dollars, euros, pounds, yen, kroner, lira and rand that are impatiently
waiting to be spent by web-savvy consumers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <p>So in 2008, spend blood, sweat and
tears on improving your ecommerce presence; the pay-off will be immediate, and far more substantial
than investing in Web 2.0 me-toos!”</p>

  <p>– Trendwatching.com,

</blockquote>

<p>Consider that this market research organisation spends most of their time talking about brand psychology,
status symbols, and the purchasing habits of particular sections of society. They are not
technology-oriented in the least. And nevertheless they are announcing the coming of the ubiquitous
internet, and its huge value for commerce. For me, this announcement marks the transition of the
mobile web from hype to reality.</p>

<p>Of course, there are still a lot of problems to overcome – the
top three are probably user experience, data traffic pricing, and handset market fragmentation. But
if the consumer demand is there, these problems can all be sorted out. People are figuring out how
to design engaging and usable mobile web sites and applications; flat rate data plans are becoming
more common (in the UK at least); and fragmentation will mean that developing for the mobile web is
a bit more expensive than it could be if everybody stuck to a standard, but it’s still an entirely
surmountable issue.</p>

<p>With the economic force of e-commerce retailers pushing technology ahead, I am
rather optimistic towards the mobile web.</p>
