                <h1>Mobile web design is so different from the desktop web</h1>

                
                <p style="font-size: 80%">Published by Martin Kleppmann on 02 Dec 2007.</p>
                

                <p>About a month ago Victor Keegan of the Guardian wrote:
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/oct/25/comment.mobilephones">“The mobile web is finally getting
started”</a>. He points out both
some of the
benefits…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is interesting why so few of us use one of the breakthroughs of recent
years: the ability to search the web from wherever we are with a mobile phone. This ought to be
hugely empowering, enabling us to answer any question from wherever we happen to be instead of
having to wait until we are within reach of a computer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…as also the main reasons for its slow start:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are a number of reasons why this hasn’t happened and why it may be about
to change. It is partly because the operators have been shamefully greedy in trying to raid our
pockets by charging for all the data we download […] the user experience is still not good
enough. Mobiles were designed to make telephone calls. Now things are
changing.”</p>

  <p>– Victor Keegan,
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/oct/25/comment.mobilephones">“The mobile web is finally getting started”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently came across some great examples demonstrating why for complex web sites, there is no
alternative to designing a specifically mobile version. This is not so much for technical reasons,
as rather that mobile users may have totally different requirements. It’s not so important to be
able to access every single bit of content; instead those things which mobile users do require need
to be instantly accessible. After all, think why a user may want to use the mobile web rather than
the desktop web: it’s very much tied to now, an instantaneous requirement. In the words of Sarah
Lipman, from an interesting paper on mobile search paradigms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Mobile Search’ = I want it NOW. I can’t wait, I won’t wait.</p>

  <p>When a user gets the sense that ‘I’m not going to find what I want right now’ he stops looking, because
that is almost always the path of least resistance. At the same time, he will also have a small
sense of failure. […] If search cannot deliver on the promise of ‘I want it NOW’, it won’t be
utilized.”</p>

  <p>– Sarah Lipman,
<a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/mex-sarahlipman.pdf">“Search patterns in nature: Informing computer search interfaces”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For mobile
users it is even more important than for normal web users that the designer has figured out exactly
what the most frequently needed aspects of his site are, and made those aspects immediately and very
easily accessible. This means that a mobile page can contain far fewer navigational elements (links)
than a page intended for desktop viewing. Going from desktop to mobile therefore involves
prioritising links in a page – some of them are going to have to go (moved into a sub-page, or
removed entirely). This is not something which software can do automatically – a human editor or
information architect has to sit down and decide.</p>

<p>Two examples to clarify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nigel Choi and
<a href="http://www.passani.it/">Luca Passani</a> have
<a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/vodafonerant/vodawsj/nigel.html">produced an impressive example</a>
contrasting the
<a href="http://mobile2.wsj.com/">mobile-specifically designed version of the Wall Street Journal</a> with its
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/">desktop version</a> when automatically adapted for mobile use. (The purpose of
the article is actually to criticise
<a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net/web/guest/forums/message_boards/message/478">Vodafone UK’s approach to content
adaptation</a>, but it
serves very well as a general example of the limitations of automatic adaptation versus manual
redesign.) The mobile-designed version even goes as far as offering all content without requiring
login (as opposed to the desktop version, a lot of which is subscription-only access), because WSJ
recognise that people don’t like typing in user names and passwords on a phone keypad!
<a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/vodafonerant/vodawsj/nigel.html">Go to the
article.</a></li>
  <li>The BBC News
website comes in at least
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/web/versions.shtml">four different versions</a>: a
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">desktop version</a>, a
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/default.stm?">PDA version</a>, a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/bbc_news/">XHTML phone version and a WAP version</a>. Simply comparing the
structure of the news front page in each version gives a very insightful comparison. When I last
checked, the front page of the desktop version contained 201 links; the PDA version contained 56
links; and the phone/WAP version contained 24 links. Same site, but different prioritisation of
content. That’s the way it should
be.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.blueflavor.com/">Blue Flavor</a> has also produced
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/39925/Everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-mobile-web-but-were-afraid-to-askblueflavorcom">a presentation on the basics of good mobile web
design</a>.</p>
