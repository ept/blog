                <h1>Please stop calling databases CP or AP</h1>

                <p>In his excellent blog post <a href="http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/">Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods</a>, Jeff Hodges
recommends that you use the <a href="http://henryr.github.io/cap-faq/">CAP theorem</a> to critique systems. A lot of people have taken
that advice to heart, describing their systems as “CP” (consistent but not available under network
partitions), “AP” (available but not consistent under network partitions), or sometimes “CA”
(meaning “I still haven’t read <a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">Coda’s post from almost 5 years ago</a>”).</p>

<p>I agree with all of Jeff’s other points, but with regard to the CAP theorem, I must disagree. The
CAP theorem is too simplistic and too widely misunderstood to be of much use for characterizing
systems. Therefore I ask that we retire all references to the CAP theorem, stop talking about the
CAP theorem, and put the poor thing to rest. Instead, we should use more precise terminology to
reason about our trade-offs.</p>

<p>(Yes, I realize the irony of writing a blog post about the very topic that I am asking people to
stop writing about. But at least it gives me a URL that I can give to people when they ask why
I don’t like them talking about the CAP theorem. Also, apologies if this is a bit of a rant, but
at least it’s a rant with lots of literature references.)</p>

<h2 id="cap-uses-very-narrow-definitions">CAP uses very narrow definitions</h2>

<p>If you want to refer to CAP as a <em>theorem</em> (as opposed to a vague hand-wavy concept in your
database’s marketing materials), you have to be precise. Mathematics requires precision. The proof
only holds if you use the words with the same meaning as they are used in <a href="http://webpages.cs.luc.edu/~pld/353/gilbert_lynch_brewer_proof.pdf">the proof</a>.
And the proof uses very particular definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Consistency</em> in CAP actually means <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf">linearizability</a>, which is a very specific (and very
strong) notion of consistency. In particular it has got nothing to do with the C in ACID, even
though that C also stands for “consistency”. I explain the meaning of linearizability below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Availability</em> in CAP is defined as “every request received by a non-failing [database] node in
the system must result in a [non-error] response”. It’s not sufficient for <em>some</em> node to be able
to handle the request: <em>any</em> non-failing node needs to be able to handle it. Many so-called
“highly available” (i.e. low downtime) systems actually do not meet this definition of
availability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Partition Tolerance</em> (terribly mis-named) basically means that you’re communicating over an
<a href="http://henryr.github.io/cap-faq/">asynchronous network</a> that may delay or drop messages. The internet and all our
datacenters <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/288-the-network-is-reliable">have this property</a>, so you don’t really have any choice in this
matter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that the CAP theorem doesn’t just describe any old system, but a very specific model of
a system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The CAP system model is a single, read-write register – that’s all. For example, the CAP theorem
says nothing about transactions that touch multiple objects: they are simply out of scope of the
theorem, unless you can somehow reduce them down to a single register.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only fault considered by the CAP theorem is a network partition (i.e. nodes remain up, but
the network between some of them is not working). That kind of fault absolutely
<a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/288-the-network-is-reliable">does happen</a>, but it’s not the only kind of thing that can go wrong: nodes can
crash or be rebooted, you can run out of disk space, you can hit a bug in the software, etc. In
building distributed systems, you need to consider a much wider range of trade-offs, and focussing
too much on the CAP theorem leads to ignoring other important issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the CAP theorem says nothing about latency, which people <a href="http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/problems-with-cap-and-yahoos-little.html">tend to care about more</a>
than availability. In fact, CAP-available systems are allowed to be arbitrarily slow to respond,
and can still be called “available”. Going out on a limb, I’d guess that your users wouldn’t call
your system “available” if it takes 2 minutes to load a page. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your use of words matches the precise definitions of the proof, then the CAP theorem applies to
you. But if you’re using some other notion of consistency or availability, you can’t expect the CAP
theorem to still apply. Of course, that doesn’t mean you can suddenly do impossible things, just by
redefining some words! It just means that you can’t turn to the CAP theorem for guidance, and you
cannot use the CAP theorem to justify your point of view.</p>

<p>If the CAP theorem doesn’t apply, that means you have to think through the trade-offs yourself. You
can reason about consistency and availability using your own definitions of those words, and you’re
welcome to prove your own theorem. But please don’t call it CAP theorem, because that name is
already taken.</p>

<h2 id="linearizability">Linearizability</h2>

<p>In case you’re not familiar with linearizability (i.e. “consistency” in the CAP sense), let me
explain it briefly. The <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf">formal definition</a> is not entirely straightforward, but
the key idea, stated informally, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If operation B started after operation A successfully completed, then operation B must see the
the system in the same state as it was on completion of operation A, or a newer state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make this more tangible, consider an example of a system that is <em>not</em> linearizable. See the
following diagram (sneak preview from an unreleased chapter of <a href="http://dataintensive.net/">my book</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/2015/05/linearizability.png" width="550" height="391" alt="Illustration of a non-linearizable sequence of events" /></p>

<p>This diagram shows Alice and Bob, who are in the same room, both checking their phones to see the
outcome of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28181689">2014 football world cup final</a>. Just after the final score is announced,
Alice refreshes the page, sees the winner announced, and excitedly tells Bob about it. Bob
incredulously hits <em>reload</em> on his own phone, but his request goes to a database replica that is
lagging, and so his phone shows that the game is still ongoing.</p>

<p>If Alice and Bob had hit reload at the same time, it wouldn’t have been surprising if they had got
two different query results, because they don’t know at exactly what time their respective requests
were processed by the server. However, Bob knows that he hit the reload button (initiated his query)
<em>after</em> he heard Alice exclaim the final score, and therefore he expects his query result to be at
least as recent as Alice’s. The fact that he got a stale query result is a violation of
linearizability.</p>

<p>Knowing that Bob’s request happened strictly after Alice’s request (i.e. that they were not
concurrent) depends on the fact that Bob heard about Alice’s query result through a separate
communication channel (in this case, IRL audio). If Bob hadn’t heard from Alice that the game was
over, he wouldn’t have known that the result of his query was stale.</p>

<p>If you’re building a database, you don’t know what kinds of backchannel your clients may have. Thus,
if you want to provide linearizable semantics (CAP-consistency) in your database, you need to make
it appear as though there is only a single copy of the data, even though there may be copies
(replicas, caches) of the data in multiple places.</p>

<p>This is a fairly expensive guarantee to provide, because it requires a lot of coordination. Even the
CPU in your computer <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/x86tso-paper.tphols.pdf">doesn’t provide linearizable access to your local RAM</a>! On modern
CPUs, you need to use an explicit <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/memory-barriersfences.html">memory barrier instruction</a> in order to get
linearizability. And even testing whether a system provides linearizability is <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/knossos">tricky</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cap-availability">CAP-Availability</h2>

<p>Let’s talk briefly about the need to give up either linearizability or availability in the case of
a network partition.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have replicas of your database in two different datacenters. The exact method of
replication doesn’t matter for now – it may be single-leader (master/slave), multi-leader
(master/master) or quorum-based replication (<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo-style</a>). The requirement of replication
is that whenever data is written to data in one datacenter, it also has to be written to the replica
in the other datacenter. Assuming that clients only connect to one datacenter, there must be
a network link between the two datacenters over which the replication happens.</p>

<p>Now assume that network link is interrupted – that’s what we mean with a <em>network partition</em>. What
happens?</p>

<p><img src="/2015/05/cap-availability.png" width="550" height="251" alt="A network partition between two datacenters" /></p>

<p>Clearly you can choose one of two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The application continues to be allowed to write to the database, so it remains fully available
in both datacenters. However, as long as the replication link is interrupted, any changes that
are written in one datacenter will not appear in the other datacenter. This violates
linearizability (in terms of the previous example, Alice could be connected to DC 1 and Bob
could be connected to DC 2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t want to lose linearizability, you have to make sure you do all your reads and
writes in one datacenter, which you may call the <em>leader</em>. In the other datacenter (which cannot
be up-to-date, due to the failed replication link), the database must stop accepting reads and
writes until the network partition is healed and the database is in sync again. Thus, although
the non-leader database has not failed, it cannot process requests, so it is not CAP-available.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(And this, by the way, is essentially the proof of the CAP theorem. That’s all there is to it. This
example uses two datacenters, but it applies equally to network problems within a single datacenter.
I just find it easier to think about when I imagine it as two datacenters.)</p>

<p>Note that in our notionally “unavailable” situation in option 2, we’re still happily processing
requests in one of the datacenters. So if a system chooses linearizability (i.e. it is not
CAP-available), that doesn’t necessarily mean that a network partition automatically leads to an
outage of the application. If you can shift all clients to using the leader datacenter, the clients
will in fact see no downtime at all.</p>

<p>Availability in practice <a href="http://blog.thislongrun.com/2015/04/cap-availability-high-availability-and_16.html">does not quite correspond</a> to CAP-availability. Your
application’s availability is probably measured with some SLA (e.g. 99.9% of well-formed requests
must return a successful response within 1 second), but such an SLA can be met both with
CAP-available and CAP-unavailable systems.</p>

<p>In practice, multi-datacenter systems <em>are</em> often designed with asynchronous replication, and thus
non-linearizable. However, the reason for that choice is often the latency of wide-area networks,
not just wanting to tolerate datacenter and network failures.</p>

<h2 id="many-systems-are-neither-linearizable-nor-cap-available">Many systems are neither linearizable nor CAP-available</h2>

<p>Under the CAP theorem’s strict definitions of consistency (linearizability) and availability, how
do systems fare?</p>

<p>For example, take any replicated database with a single leader, which is the standard way of setting
up replication in most relational databases. In this configuration, if a client is partitioned from
the leader, it cannot write to the database. Even though it may be able to read from a follower (a
read-only replica), the fact that it cannot write means any single-leader setup is not
CAP-available. Never mind that such configurations are often marketed as “high availability”.</p>

<p>If single-leader replication is not CAP-available, does that make it “CP”? Wait, not so fast. If you
allow the application to make reads from a follower, and the replication is asynchronous (the
default in most databases), then a follower may be a little behind the leader when you read from it.
In this case, your reads will not be linearizable, i.e. not CAP-consistent.</p>

<p>Moreover, databases with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69541/tr-95-51.pdf">snapshot isolation</a>/MVCC are intentionally non-linearizable,
because enforcing linearizability would reduce the level of concurrency that the database can offer.
For example, <a href="http://drkp.net/papers/ssi-vldb12.pdf">PostgreSQL’s SSI</a> provides <em>serializability</em> but not
<em>linearizability</em>, and <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220225203_Making_snapshot_isolation_serializable/file/e0b49520567eace81f.pdf">Oracle provides neither</a>. Just because a database is branded “ACID”
doesn’t mean it meets the CAP theorem’s definition of consistency.</p>

<p>So these systems are neither CAP-consistent nor CAP-available. They are neither “CP” nor “AP”, they
are just “P”, whatever that means. (Yes, the “two out of three” formulation <em>does</em> allow you to pick
only one out of three, or even none out of three!)</p>

<p>What about “NoSQL”? Take MongoDB, for example: it has a single leader per shard (or at least it’s
supposed to, if it’s not in split-brain mode), so it’s not CAP-available by the argument above. And
Kyle <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/322-call-me-maybe-mongodb-stale-reads">recently showed</a> that it allows non-linearizable reads even at the highest
consistency setting, so it’s not CAP-consistent either.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a> derivatives like Riak, Cassandra and Voldemort, which are often called “AP” since
they optimize for high availability? It depends on your settings. If you accept a single replica for
reads and writes (R=W=1), they are indeed CAP-available. However, if you require quorum reads and
writes (R+W&gt;N), and you have a network partition, clients on the minority side of the partition
cannot reach a quorum, so quorum operations are not CAP-available (at least temporarily, until the
database sets up additional replicas on the minority side).</p>

<p>You sometimes see people people claiming that quorum reads and writes guarantee linearizability, but
I think it would be unwise to rely on it – subtle combinations of features such as sloppy quorums
and read repair can lead to <a href="http://basho.com/riaks-config-behaviors-part-3/">tricky edge cases</a> in which deleted data is resurrected,
or the number of replicas of a value falls below the original W (violating the quorum condition), or
the number of replica nodes increases above the original N (again violating the quorum condition).
All of these lead to non-linearizable outcomes.</p>

<p>These are not bad systems: people successfully use them in production all the time. However, so far
we haven’t been able to rigorously classify them as “AP” or “CP”, either because it depends on the
particular operation or configuration, or because the system meets neither of the CAP theorem’s
strict definitions of consistency or availability.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-zookeeper">Case study: ZooKeeper</h2>

<p>What about ZooKeeper? It uses a <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf">consensus algorithm</a>, so people generally regard it as a
<a href="http://www.knewton.com/tech/blog/2014/12/eureka-shouldnt-use-zookeeper-service-discovery/">clear-cut case of choosing consistency over availability</a> (i.e. a “CP system”).</p>

<p>However, if you look at the <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkGuarantees">ZooKeeper docs</a>, they make quite clear that ZooKeeper
by default <em>does not</em> provide linearizable reads. Each client is connected to one of the server
nodes, and when you make a read, you see only the data on that node, even if there are more
up-to-date writes on another node. This makes reads much faster than if you had to assemble a quorum
or contact the leader for every read, but it also means that ZooKeeper by default <em>does not</em> meet
the CAP theorem’s definition of consistency.</p>

<p>It is possible to make linearizable reads in ZooKeeper by <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/zookeeper-user/201303.mbox/%3CCAJwFCa0Hoekc14Zy6i0LyLj=eraF8JimqMZadohoKQJNTMtYSg@mail.gmail.com%3E">preceding a read with a <code>sync</code>
command</a>. That isn’t the default though, because it comes with a performance penalty.
People do use <code>sync</code>, but usually not all the time.</p>

<p>What about ZooKeeper availability? Well, ZK requires a <a href="http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Studies/T-79.5001/reports/2012-deSouzaMedeiros.pdf">majority quorum</a> in
order to reach consensus, i.e. in order to process writes. If you have a partition with a majority
of the nodes on one side and a minority on the other, then the majority side continues to function,
but the nodes on the minority side can’t process writes, even though the nodes are up. Thus, writes
in ZK are not CAP-available under a partition (even though the majority side can continue to process
writes).</p>

<p>To add to the fun, ZooKeeper 3.4.0 added a <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#Experimental+Options%2FFeatures">read-only mode</a>, in which nodes on the
minority side of a partition can continue serving read requests – no quorum needed! This read-only
mode <em>is</em> CAP-available. Thus, ZooKeeper by default is neither CAP-consistent (CP) nor CAP-available
(AP) – it’s really just “P”. However, you can optionally make it CP by calling <code>sync</code> if you want,
and for reads (but not for writes) it’s actually AP, if you turn on the right option.</p>

<p>But this is irritating. Calling ZooKeeper “not consistent”, just because it’s not linearizable by
default, really badly misrepresents its features. It actually provides an excellent level of
consistency! It provides <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf">atomic broadcast</a> (which is <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf">reducible to consensus</a>)
combined with the session guarantee of <a href="http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/i2/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Seminar_MCMM11/Causal_memory_1996.pdf">causal consistency</a> – which is <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.0309.pdf">stronger</a>
than <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Terry3/publication/3561300_Session_guarantees_for_weakly_consistent_replicated_data/links/02e7e52cdbe60a6cb4000000.pdf">read your writes, monotonic reads</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/157411/ConsistencyAndBaseballReport.pdf">consistent prefix reads</a> combined.
The documentation says that it provides <a href="http://research-srv.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/multi.pdf">sequential consistency</a>, but it’s under-selling
itself, because ZooKeeper’s guarantees are in fact much stronger than sequential consistency.</p>

<p>As ZooKeeper demonstrates, it is quite reasonable to have a system that is neither CAP-consistent
nor CAP-available in the presence of partitions, and by default isn’t even linearizable in the
<em>absence</em> of partitions. (I guess that would be PC/EL in <a href="http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/problems-with-cap-and-yahoos-little.html">Abadi’s PACELC framework</a>, but
I don’t find that any more enlightening than CAP.)</p>

<h2 id="cpap-a-false-dichotomy">CP/AP: a false dichotomy</h2>

<p>The fact that we haven’t been able to classify even one datastore as unambiguously “AP” or “CP”
should be telling us something: those are simply not the right labels to describe systems.</p>

<p>I believe that we should stop putting datastores into the “AP” or “CP” buckets, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Within one piece of software, you may well have various operations with <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Gilbert/Brewer2.pdf">different consistency
characteristics</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many systems are neither consistent nor available under the CAP theorem’s definitions. However,
I’ve never heard anyone call their system just “P”, presumably because it looks bad. But it’s not
bad – it may be a perfectly reasonable design, it just doesn’t fit one of the two CP/AP buckets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though most software doesn’t neatly fit one of those two buckets, people try to shoehorn
software into one of the two buckets anyway, thereby inevitably changing the meaning of
“consistency” or “availability” to whatever definition suits them. Unfortunately, if the meaning
of the words is changed, the CAP theorem no longer applies, and thus the CP/AP distinction is
rendered completely meaningless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A huge amount of subtlety is lost by putting a system in one of two buckets. There are many
considerations of fault-tolerance, latency, simplicity of programming model, operability, etc.
that feed into the design of a distributed systems. It is simply not possible to encode this
subtlety in one bit of information. For example, even though ZooKeeper has an “AP” read-only mode,
this mode still provides a total ordering of historical writes, which is a vastly stronger
guarantee than the “AP” in a system like Riak or Cassandra – so it’s ridiculous to throw them
into the same bucket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even Eric Brewer <a href="http://cs609.cs.ua.edu/CAP12.pdf">admits</a> that CAP is misleading and oversimplified. In 2000, it was meant
to start a discussion about trade-offs in distributed data systems, and it did that very well. It
wasn’t intended to be a breakthrough formal result, nor was it meant to be a rigorous
classification scheme for data systems. 15 years later, we now have a much greater range of tools
with different consistency and fault-tolerance models to choose from. CAP has served its purpose,
and now it’s time to move on.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-to-think-for-yourself">Learning to think for yourself</h2>

<p>If CP and AP are unsuitable to describe and critique systems, what should you use instead? I don’t
think there is one right answer. Many people have thought hard about these problems, and proposed
terminology and models to help us understand problems. To learn about those ideas, you’ll have to go
deeper into the literature.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A good starting point is Doug Terry’s paper in which he <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/157411/ConsistencyAndBaseballReport.pdf">explains various different levels of
eventual consistency using Baseball examples</a>. It’s very readable and clear, even if
(like me) you’re not American and have no clue about Baseball.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re interested in transaction isolation models (which is not the same as consistency of
distributed replicas, but somewhat related), my little project <a href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/2014/11/25/hermitage-testing-the-i-in-acid.html">Hermitage</a> may be relevant.</p>
  </li>

replica consistency, transaction isolation and availability are explored by <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.0309.pdf">Peter Bailis et
al.</a> (That paper also explains the meaning of that hierarchy of consistency levels which
Kyle Kingsbury <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/322-call-me-maybe-mongodb-stale-reads">likes to show</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you’ve read those, you should be ready to dive deeper into the literature. I’ve scattered
a ton of links to papers throughout this post. Do take a look at them: a number of experts have
already figured out a lot of stuff for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a last resort, if you can’t face reading the original papers, I suggest you take a look at
<a href="http://dataintensive.net/">my book</a>, which summarizes the most important ideas in an approachable manner. (See,
I tried <em>very hard</em> not to make this post a sales pitch.)</p>
  </li>

    <p>If you want to know more specifically about using ZooKeeper correctly, 
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028901.do">Flavio Junqueira and Benjamin Reed’s book</a> is good.</p>

<p>Whatever way you choose to learn, I encourage you to be curious and patient – this stuff doesn’t
come easy. But it’s rewarding, because you learn to reason about trade-offs, and thus figure out
what kind of architecture works best for your particular application. But whatever you do, please
stop talking about CP and AP, because they just don’t make any sense.</p>
