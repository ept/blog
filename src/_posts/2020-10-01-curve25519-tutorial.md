Abstract
--------

Many textbooks cover the concepts behind Elliptic Curve Cryptography, but few explain how to go from
the equations to a working, fast, and secure implementation. On the other hand, while the code of
many cryptographic libraries is available as open source, it can be rather opaque to the untrained
eye, and it is rarely accompanied by detailed documentation explaining how the code came about and
why it is correct. This tutorial bridges the gap between the mathematics and implementation of
elliptic curve cryptography. It is written for readers who are new to cryptography, and it assumes
very little mathematical background. Starting from first principles, this paper shows how to derive
every line of code in an implementation of the X25519 Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme, based on
the Curve25519 elliptic curve. The implementation is fast and secure; in particular, it is
constant-time to prevent side-channel attacks.
