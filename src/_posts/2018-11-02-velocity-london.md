Abstract
--------

We all know how to build web apps around a central server. However, clients — especially mobile
clients — are not always online and thus can’t always reach the server. Increasingly, we want to
develop apps in which the user can still get work done while offline, and to sync their data the
next time an Internet connection is available.

We call such apps “offline-first”. However, in the offline-first world there is an issue that is not
so often talked about: moving from server-centric to offline-first deeply changes the programming
model. For example, if several users each change the data while offline, how do you merge them back
together again?

In this talk, Martin will show how recent computer science research is helping develop the
abstractions and APIs for the next generation of applications.
