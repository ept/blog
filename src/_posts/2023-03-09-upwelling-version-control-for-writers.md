Abstract
--------

Collaboration features of existing software do not sufficiently meet the needs of professional
non-fiction writers. Real-time collaboration in cloud applications like Google Docs can create
stress when writers feel watched by their co-authors, and file-based collaboration can introduce
difficulty with versioning and merging edits from different co-authors. Further, in environments
where accuracy is crucial, like newsrooms, existing tools make reviewing changes unnecessarily
difficult.

In the Upwelling project we have built an experimental editor that aims to satisfy the needs of
professional writers and editors. It allows co-authors to collaborate in real time when they wish
to, but it also supports work on private drafts that can be shared and merged only when their
authors are ready. By combining elements of real-time collaboration with ideas from version control
systems, Upwelling supports writers in maintaining their creative privacy and editors in ensuring
accurate results.
