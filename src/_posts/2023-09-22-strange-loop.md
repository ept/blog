Abstract
--------

Real-time collaboration made apps like Google Docs and Figma popular, and many other apps have also
been adding similar features. However, the algorithms that enable collaboration are surprisingly
tricky, even for seemingly simple data types like text. In this talk I will share insights from our
recent research on collaborative text editing, answering questions such as: How can we combine ideas
from version control, such as branches and pull requests, with real-time sharing? And how can we
move from cloud-centric apps to a more decentralised, local-first model of software without
sacrificing features or performance?
