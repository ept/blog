title: Several podcast interviews

<!--
Also got asked to go on https://podcast.sustainoss.org/ and https://nurkiewicz.com/
and https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/

I regularly get asked to give interviews on the topics that I work on, especially for podcasts.
To make them easier to find for anybody who's interested, I thought I would make a list.
They touch on a range of different topics, although there is also some overlap so I wouldn't
recommend listening to them all in a row!

(By the way, if you want a list of conference talks I have given, I have a
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDHJxge6VtYUAbYnvd_VNQCx) for that.)

Here's a list of interviews I've given as of September 2021:

* Interview with [Wix Engineering](https://www.wix.engineering/), in which we discuss my book, the
  state of Automerge, the convergence of streaming systems and databases, Kafka's move to replace
  ZooKeeper with their own Raft implementation, impact of my research, and more.
  Recorded 16 June 2021, published 26 August 2021.

* Interview with the [Metamuse podcast](https://museapp.com/podcast/), in which we discuss local-first
  software: how the concept has evolved since we [first articulated it](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html),
  and where it's heading in the future.
