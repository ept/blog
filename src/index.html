<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I’m Dr. Martin Kleppmann. I do various things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I am a research fellow at the
        <a href="https://www.in.tum.de/en/">TU Munich Department of Informatics</a>,
        <a href="https://www.in.tum.de/en/in/news-single-view-en/article/dr-m-kleppmann-receives-freigeist-fellowship-from-the-volkswagen-foundation0/">funded</a>
        by a <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/funding/our-funding-portfolio-at-a-glance/freigeist-fellowships">Freigeist Fellowship</a>
        from the <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en">Volkswagen Foundation</a>
        (which is independent from the car company, in case you were wondering).
        I previously spent seven years in research at the
        <a href="http://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>,
        where I received a
        <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships">Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship</a>.</li>
    <li>I work on <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">local-first</a> collaboration software
        and distributed systems security, and I teach an undergraduate
        <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2122/ConcDisSys/dist-sys-notes.pdf">course on distributed systems</a>.</li>
    <li>If you have found my work useful, please

        Thank you to my <a href="supporters.html">supporters</a>!</li>
    <li>In 2017 I published a book for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a>, called
        <a href="https://dataintensive.net">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>.
        It covers the architecture of a broad range of databases and distributed data processing systems,
        and it is one of the best-selling titles in the publisher’s entire catalogue.</li>
    <li>I am a regular <a href="/talks.html">speaker at conferences</a>, and

    <li>I have composed several musical works, including
